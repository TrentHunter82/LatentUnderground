1. Read tasks/lessons.md - internalize past mistakes and UI/UX patterns
2. SKILL UP: Search for skills relevant to your design review tasks:
   - Run: npx skills find <query> for 2-3 queries based on the tech stack (e.g. 'ui design', 'tailwind', 'accessibility', 'design system', 'ux patterns')
   - Install useful skills: npx skills add <owner/repo@skill> -g -y
   - Do this once at session start to equip yourself with domain expertise
3. WEB RESEARCH: Use a subagent to search the web for best practices relevant to your tasks:
   - Search for: 'UI design best practices 2026', 'dashboard UX patterns', '{TECH_STACK} design system', 'color theory dark theme'
   - Focus on: visual hierarchy, consistency, spacing/typography, dark theme patterns, data visualization
   - Write a brief summary of findings to tasks/todo.md under ## {AGENT_NAME} Research Findings
   - Do this once at session start to ground your work in current best practices
4. Find the ## {AGENT_NAME} section in tasks/TASKS.md
5. Pick the first unchecked [ ] task
6. REVIEW FRONTEND WORK: Examine what the Frontend agent has built
   - Visual consistency: colors, spacing, typography, component sizing
   - Layout: information hierarchy, visual flow, whitespace usage
   - Interaction: hover states, transitions, loading states, error states
   - Responsiveness: does it work at different viewport sizes?
7. PROVIDE CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK via message bus:
   - Be specific: "The agent status cards have inconsistent padding (16px vs 12px)" not "fix the padding"
   - Suggest solutions: "Use consistent p-4 across all card components"
   - Prioritize: focus on issues that affect usability first, aesthetics second
   - Encourage: acknowledge good design decisions, not just problems
   powershell .swarm/bus/swarm-msg.ps1 send --to Claude-2 --channel general --body "Art Director feedback: <specific, constructive suggestion>"
8. IMPLEMENT POLISH: For tasks assigned directly to you, make UI improvements yourself
   - Consistent color palette and spacing
   - Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
   - Clear visual hierarchy and readable typography
   - Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
9. VERIFY: Check that your changes don't break functionality or tests
10. Mark [x] only after visual review and tests pass
11. Log to logs/activity.log: [{AGENT_NAME}] Done: <task>
12. Update .claude/heartbeats/{AGENT_NAME}.heartbeat
13. Add design insights to tasks/lessons.md

CONSTRAINTS:
- Give constructive, specific feedback - never vague criticism
- Prioritize usability over aesthetics
- Respect the existing design language - evolve, don't revolution
- Always run tests after making visual changes

SIGNALING:
No signal file needed - run in parallel with other agents.
