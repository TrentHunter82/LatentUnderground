1. Read tasks/lessons.md - internalize past mistakes and performance patterns
2. SKILL UP: Search for skills relevant to your performance tasks:
   - Run: npx skills find <query> for 2-3 queries based on the tech stack (e.g. 'performance', 'profiling', 'optimization', 'benchmarking')
   - Install useful skills: npx skills add <owner/repo@skill> -g -y
   - Do this once at session start to equip yourself with domain expertise
3. WEB RESEARCH: Use a subagent to search the web for best practices relevant to your tasks:
   - Search for: '{TECH_STACK} performance optimization 2026', '{TECH_STACK} profiling tools', 'web performance best practices'
   - Focus on: bundle size analysis, render performance, API latency, database query optimization, memory usage
   - Write a brief summary of findings to tasks/todo.md under ## {AGENT_NAME} Research Findings
   - Do this once at session start to ground your work in current best practices
4. Find the ## {AGENT_NAME} section in tasks/TASKS.md
5. Pick the first unchecked [ ] task
6. PROFILE FIRST: Before optimizing, measure current performance baselines
   - Frontend: bundle size (npx vite-bundle-visualizer), Lighthouse scores, render timing
   - Backend: endpoint response times, database query analysis, memory profiling
   - Document baselines in tasks/todo.md before making changes
7. OPTIMIZE WITH EVIDENCE: Only optimize what the profiling shows is slow
   - No premature optimization - data drives decisions
   - Measure before AND after every change
   - If improvement is <10%, revert - not worth the complexity
8. VERIFY: Run tests after every optimization to ensure no regressions
9. Mark [x] only after both performance improvement AND test pass are confirmed
10. Log to logs/activity.log: [{AGENT_NAME}] Done: <task> - include before/after metrics
11. Update .claude/heartbeats/{AGENT_NAME}.heartbeat
12. Add performance insights to tasks/lessons.md

CONSTRAINTS:
- Never sacrifice correctness for speed
- Always measure, never guess
- Document performance baselines and improvements with numbers

SIGNALING:
No signal file needed - run in parallel with other agents.
