    "Goal": "Make Latent Underground fully controllable from the web UI - no terminal management needed. Polish per-agent orchestration, fix bugs, improve reliability.",
    "StartTime": "2026-02-11 05:30:00",
    "Requirements": "Existing codebase in backend/ and frontend/ - DO NOT start from scratch. Build on what exists. Per-agent orchestration is newly implemented - the backend now spawns each agent as a subprocess and captures output. The web UI has agent sub-tabs, per-agent stop, and stdin input. Focus on making the full launch→monitor→control→stop flow work seamlessly from the browser with zero terminal windows."
